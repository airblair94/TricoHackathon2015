But what did magic mean to the people who coined the term, the people of ancient Greece and Rome? Drawing on the expanding body of evidence for ancient magical practices, as well as recent theoretical approaches to the history of religions, this seminar explores the varieties of phenomena labeled magic in the ancient Greco-Roman world.  Bindings and curses, love charms and healing potions, amulets and talismans - from the simple spells designed to meet the needs of the poor and desperate to the complex theurgies of the philosophers, the people of the Greco-Roman world did not only imagine what magic could do, they also made use of magic to try to influence the world around them. The seminar examines the primary texts in Greek, the tablets and spell books, as well as literary descriptions of magic, in the light of theories relating to the religious, political, and social contexts in which magic was used.",,,,[u'03:00pm'],,,"Edmonds,Radcliffe",,TH223,645,CSTSB645001,,spring_2013,[u'01:00pm'],Ancient Magic

One of its aims is to explore the broad range of thematic interests inherent in these traditions, sharing as they do common roots in the history of our language and its influences. The powers and limits of language; ideas of character and community, and the relation between person and place; heroic endeavor and the mystery of evil; loss and renovation these are among the themes to be tracked through various strategies of literary representation and interpretation in a variety of genres (epic, narrative, and poetry) and modes (realism, allegory, and romance), and across a range of historical periods. Our goal is to develop the vocabulary, skills, and knowledge necessary to understand not only how we decide what literary texts mean, but also how literary texts generate and contemplate meaning.

The powers and limits of language; ideas of character and community, and the relation between person and place; heroic endeavor and the mystery of evil; loss and renovation these are among the themes to be tracked through various strategies of literary representation and interpretation in a variety of genres (epic, narrative, and poetry) and modes (realism, allegory, and romance), and across a range of historical periods.

One of its aims is to explore the broad range of thematic interests inherent in these traditions, sharing as they do common roots in the history of our language and its influences. The powers and limits of language; ideas of character and community, and the relation between person and place; heroic endeavor and the mystery of evil; loss and renovation these are among the themes to be tracked through various strategies of literary representation and interpretation in a variety of genres (epic, narrative, and poetry) and modes (realism, allegory, and romance), and across a range of historical periods. Our goal is to develop the vocabulary, skills, and knowledge necessary to understand not only how we decide what literary texts mean, but also how literary texts generate and contemplate meaning.

Rebuilding generally ensued at a very rapid pace, often as a continuation of the past. Following a brief examination of literature on disaster and rebuilding and a historical overview of architectural and urban history in Japan, this course explores the reasons for historical transformations large and small. It specifically argues that rebuilding was mostly the result of traditions, whereas transformation of urban space occurred primarily as a result of political and socio-economic change. Focusing on the period since the Meiji restoration of 1868, we ask: How did reconstruction after natural and man-made disasters shape the contemporary Japanese landscape? We will explore specifically the destruction and rebuilding after the 1891 Nobi earthquake, the 1923 Great Kanto earthquake that leveled Tokyo and Yokohama, the bombing of more than 200 cities in World War II and their rebuilding, as well as the 1995 Great Hanshin earthquake that destroyed Kobe and its reconstruction. In the context of the long history of destruction and rebuilding we will finally explore the recent disaster in Fukushima 2011.
